				<p><b>1. What is Git?</b> <br> Git is a very popular version control system used today. This allows your code to become a complete version control repository, which makes it simple to work offline.</p>
				
				<p><b>2. Who started Git?</b> <br> Git was developed by Linus Torvalds, the creator of the Linux operating system kernel, in 2005.</p>
				
				<p><b>3. What is Hub?</b> <br> A hub (network hub) is a connection point in a network for devices that are commonly used to connect segments of a LAN. </p>
				
				<p><b>4. Describe Repository and its role.</b> <br> A repository is where data is kept and maintained in an organized way. It is usually used to allow users to access the data in the repository directly.</p>

				<p><b>5. Your thoughts about GitHub.</b> <br> I've heard of GitHub before, but it's something that I've never touched upon. A lot of programmers on Youtube mention that it's a very good idea to be active in GitHub because it allows you to build up your resume for future programming jobs. I am happy that this class is exposing me more GitHub and I'm hoping for more involvement in the future.</p>
